Over the years we have received many requests for Pupil + MatLab integration. Members of the community have developed scripts for matlab + Pupil communication that have been incredibly useful to the Pupil + MatLab community. We are pleased add an official helper script that enables you to communicate with Pupil over network communication with Pupil.

Check out the helper scripts in the Pupil Matlab Helpers [repository](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil-helpers/tree/master/matlab).
