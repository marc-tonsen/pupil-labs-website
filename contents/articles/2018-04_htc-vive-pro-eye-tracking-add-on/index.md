We are pleased to announce that our eye tracking add-on for the HTC Vive is 100% compatible with the new HTC Vive PRO VR headset.

The add-on can be connected to the Vive PRO's built in USBC port, or directly to your computer using a separate USB cable routed alongside the HMDI tether.

It is a snap-fit assembly that requires no tools or modifications to the Vive.

Add eye tracking to your VR/AR projects by using our Unity3d plugin [hmd-eyes](https://github.com/pupil-labs/hmd-eyes).
