We are pleased to announce our eye tracking add-on for the **HTC Vive Pro** VR headset. 

It is a snap-fit assembly that requires no tools or modifications to the Vive. We have managed to move all components out of the user's field of view.

Check out the stetup video below.

The add-on can be connected to the Vive's built in USBC port, or directly to your computer using a separate USB cable routed alongside the HMDI tether.

The add-on is fully compatible with Pupil Capture and Pupil Service software. As always, you will have raw access to the video streams if you prefer to build your own pipeline. 

Add eye tracking to your VR/AR projects by using our Unity3d plugin [hmd-eyes](https://github.com/pupil-labs/hmd-eyes). 

We start taking orders today. Check it out in the [store](/store/#vr-ar).
